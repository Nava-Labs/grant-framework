## Project Overview

Neutroswap is an automated market-maker (AMM) on the EOS EVM blockchain that is community-driven and offers the low fees for swapping assets. It also has some of the most lucrative rewards for staking and yield farming in the entire EOS EVM ecosystem, making it an appealing choice for those looking to generate returns on their assets. 
Our team decides to focus more towards bringing liquidity to EOS EVM chain more. It will enable more users, projects and exposure coming to EOS EVM due to TVL increase and project development. 

### Overview

- **Name:** Neutroswap
- **Brief Description:** Community-driven AMM & Launchpad on EOS EVM
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** Our app brings liquidity to EOS EVM attracting more projects and users to use the chain.
- **Reason for Interest:** Capital efficiency, impermanent loss mitigation, higher fee rewards, reduced slippage, improved price discovery for our app users

### Project Details

We have successfully launched Neutroswap V2:
1. The first DApp that reached $1,000,000 in TVL
2. The first EOS EVM token listed on Coingecko
3. The first working app on EOS EVM and has active users.
4. Bring more than 2000+ transactions on average per day since launch
5. Bring $150,000+ volume daily accross Neutroswap V2 DEX
6. The first project that triggers influencers to look at EOS EVM

Now, we want to move on to V3 and make our position stronger in EOS EVM. With V3, we're introducing concentrated liquidity, an innovative approach to liquidity provision that allows liquidity providers (LPs) to enhance their capital efficiency and minimize impermanent loss by focusing their liquidity within a particular price range. By enabling LPs to stake specific token pairs within a designated price range, this novel method leads to a more efficient allocation of resources compared to conventional liquidity provision techniques.

#### Benefits of Concentrated Liquidity

1. Capital efficiency: LPs allocate funds within a chosen price range, allowing for more effective use of capital.
2. Impermanent loss mitigation: Concentrating liquidity in a specific range helps reduce exposure to price fluctuations, mitigating impermanent loss.
3. Customized strategies: LPs can tailor their strategies based on risk tolerance, market outlook, and price predictions, by selecting any desired price range. The tighter the range, the more liquidity passes through the position, and the more the LP earns.
4. Higher fee rewards: LPs can potentially earn higher trading fee rewards proportional to their contribution within the active price range.
5. Reduced slippage: Traders benefit from deeper liquidity where it's needed the most, resulting in reduced slippage and better execution prices.
6. Improved price discovery: Concentrated liquidity can lead to more accurate price discovery, as liquidity is focused on price ranges with higher trading activity and demand.

#### V2 Pools vs Concentrated Liquidity
V2 pools employ the XYK model, which maintains a constant balance within a liquidity pool so that the total value of one token always equals the total value of the other token in the pool, regardless of their current price against each other. In V2 pools, liquidity is spread across all possible price ranges, making it difficult for LPs to decide where to allocate liquidity. In reality, the majority of their liquidity remains unused.

In contrast, concentrated liquidity allows LPs to focus their liquidity within a specific price range, resulting in better capital efficiency, reduced impermanent loss, and increased trading fee rewards. Moreover, concentrated liquidity enables LPs to create customized strategies by allocating their capital to preferred price intervals.

##### V2 Pools:
- Based on the XYK model
- Liquidity spread across all possible price ranges
- Difficult for LPs to decide where to allocate liquidity
- Higher slippage and lower trading fee rewards

##### Concentrated Liquidity Pools:
- Customizable price ranges
- More efficient use of capital
- Reduced impermanent loss and higher trading fee rewards
- Allows LPs to create tailored strategies

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? Currently, EOS EVM needs more TVL to achieve organic exposure and attract new users. That's why we're thrilled to have already seen significant growth since our launch. But we're not stopping there. Our team is committed to further strengthening EOS EVM by providing even more value through our upcoming V3 version. With V3, we're confident that we can continue to drive growth and make EOS EVM an even more vibrant and successful ecosystem
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)? Farmers, DeFi users, crypto users in general, traders
- What need(s) does your project meet? Neutroswap V3 will have benefits: impermanent loss mitigation, increased flexibility, higher performance. Especially it can bring more TVL to EOS EVM.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOS Network / Antelope ecosystem?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems? Noahswap, Frogge might release the same solutions in the future.

## Future Plans

With the launch of concentrated liquidity, we will open new fresh farms for people to join and stake their LP tokens. With this it will increase EOS EVM chain and our app TVL significantly. To ensure that the community is aware of this exciting new development, we will be reaching out to influencers and high IQ DeFi traders to encourage them to join and take advantage of the benefits offered by Neutroswap V3.

In addition, our concentrated liquidity feature will also help to lock up more $NEUTRO tokens, providing further benefits to our loyal token holders. We're confident that this new version will take Neutroswap to the next level and solidify our position as a leader in the EOS EVM DeFi space

## Additional Information

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** EOS Network Foundation Twitter / personal recommendation

As we look to the future of Neutroswap and EOS EVM, we believe that a grant to bring liquidity to the platform is essential. We've been proud to build Neutroswap without raising any investment from VC firms, and we're hopeful that ENF will see the value in our work and provide the support we need to continue to grow and innovate on EOS EVM.

We have done our best to trigger the initial wave of EOS EVM by becoming:
1. The first DApp that reached $1,000,000 in TVL
2. The first EOS EVM token listed on Coingecko
3. The first working app on EOS EVM and has active users.
4. Bring more than 2000+ transactions on average per day since launch
5. Bring $150,000+ volume daily accross Neutroswap V2 DEX
6. The first project that triggers influencers to look at EOS EVM

We're committed to continuing this momentum and pushing the boundaries of what's possible on EOS EVM. With ENF's support, we believe that we can take Neutroswap and the EOS EVM ecosystem to new heights. Thank you for considering our proposal
